<h2><a name = "rayTriangle">Task 6: Ray Intersect Triangle (8 points)</a></h2>

<p>
  The purpose of this GUI is to help you test your ray intersect triangle task.  Choose a ray by specifying the endpoint <b>p0</b> and the direction <b>v</b>, and choose the three vertices of the triangle in question.  Then click "compute intersection."  The result will be shown in a 3D plot to the right.  If there is an intersection, the intersection point will be drawn as point <b>d</b>, and a line segment will be extended from the ray endpoint to that point.  If not, just the ray from <b>p0</b> to <b>p0 + v</b> will be drawn.
